# How to contribute

## Making Changes

* Create a branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git branch
    fix-my-contribution master` then checkout the new branch with `git
    checkout fix-my-contribution`.  Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to this repository.
